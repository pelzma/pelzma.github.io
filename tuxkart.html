## Image Agent Design for SuperTuxKart Ice Hockey

For the final project in a course on Deep Learning, I collaborated with two teammates to design an autonomous agent for the SuperTuxKart Ice Hockey video game.
We created image-based agents to compete in 2-on-2 hockey matches. Using our own generated data of gameplay images, we trained neural networks to determine
on-screen puck locations, and we designed a controller to try to capture the puck and steer it into the appropriate goal. For more information on our data 
generation methods and network architecture, email me!
